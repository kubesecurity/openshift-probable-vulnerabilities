I found instances where certain keywords such as TODO, HACK, FIXME, bug repository IDs, in comments within Chef scripts. According to the Common Weakness Enumeration organization this is a security weakness (CWE-546: Suspicious Comment https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/546.html).  I am trying to find out if you agree with the findings. I think it is possible to have a nuanced perspective. Any feedback is appreciated.
